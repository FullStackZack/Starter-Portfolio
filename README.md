For Homework 2, we were asked to create a responsive portfolio website.

Minimum Requirements:

Functional, deployed application

GitHub repository with README describing the project

Navbar must be consistent on each page.

Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

All links must work.

Must use semantic html.

Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

Results:

While I believe I met the minimum requirements, unfotunately I was unable to get media queries down. I found this area to be very tough. I couldn't figure out how to make my mobile-deployed website work properly.

Overall, I felt like I did well - just need to lock down media queries. Fun assignment!
